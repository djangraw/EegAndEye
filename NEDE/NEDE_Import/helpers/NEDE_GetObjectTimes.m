function [object_nums,object_times] = NEDE_GetObjectTimes(visible, maxFrameTime)

% Generates a timestamp and event number for each time an object enters or
% exits the subject's view.
%
% [object_nums, object_times] = NEDE_GetObjectTimes(visible, maxFrameTime)
% 
% INPUTS:
% - object_limits is an nx6 matrix, where n is the number of frames in
% which an object was visible.  It is the output of get_objectlimits.m.
% - maxFrameTime (optional) is a scalar indicating the maximum time (in ms)
% expected between display frames. This will determine whether a delay 
% between visibility events meanse the object disappeared and reappeared or 
% not. [default = 100ms]
%
% OUTPUTS:
% -object_times is an mx2 matrix, where m is the number of frames in
% which an object entered or exited the scene.

% Inputs
if nargin<2 || isempty(maxFrameTime)

% Setup
all_objects = unique(visible.object); % all objects that were seen
times = visible.time; % extract times for easy access.
object_nums = [];

% Get object events

    object_nums = [object_nums; repmat(all_objects(i),numel(appeartimes),1)];
    object_times = [object_times; cat(2,appeartimes, disappeartimes)];

% Sort into chronological order
