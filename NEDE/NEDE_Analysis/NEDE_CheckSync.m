function delay = NEDE_CheckSync(x,EEG,SYNC_CODES)

% Extracts and compares the sync event times according to the eye tracker
% and the EEG to check for consistency.
%
% delay = NEDE_CheckSync(x,EEG,SYNC_CODES)
%
% NOTES:
% - Sync events are sent every couple of seconds from the eyelink (which
% records the time each was sent) to the EEG (which records the time it was
% received). 
% - Sync events will be used to translate eyelink times into EEG times for
% analysis.
%
% INPUTS:
% - x is a NEDE data struct (or vector of structs).
% - EEG is an EEGLAB data struct (containing the corresponding EEG files
% concatenated using pop_mergeset).
% - SYNC_CODES is a vector of numbers that should be counted as sync events.
%
% Created 6/14/10 by DJ - as part of CheckData.
% Updated 7/28/10 by DJ - made into its own program.
% Updated 7/29/10 by DJ - changed events field back to eyelink.
% Updated 12/6/13 by DJ - added delay output, cleaned up.
% Updated 2/11/14 by DJ - added multi-session support
% Updated 9/25/14 by DJ - added SYNC_CODES input
% Updated 10/22/14 by DJ - turned event check back on
