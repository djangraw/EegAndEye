% ts_saccades = matchSaccadesToObjects(timestamps,ts_events)
% -This function takes the results of find_writeioport and 
% find_saccadeevents and uses them to find which object the subject was
% looking at with each recorded saccade.
% -the OUTPUT ts_saccades is an nx2 matrix, where n is the number of
% saccades in the experiment.  The first column is the eyelink timestamp of
% the end time of a saccade, and the second column is the number of the
% object to which a saccade was made.
