function Numbers = GetNumbers(when)

% Get the constants specific to the 3DSearch task. 
%
% Numbers = GetNumbers(when)
% GetNumbers; (this is equivalent to Numbers = GetNumbers(now);)
%
% INPUTS:
% -when is a datestring (e.g. '8/3/2010') or datenum (e.g. now) indicating
% the time when the current data file was imported (this will be important
% if the file is using old, outdated constants).
%
% OUTPUTS:
% -Numbers is the struct.
%
% Should be similar to the constants section of Numbers.js from the 
% current experiment (adjusting variable declarations for MATLAB).
%
% Function GetNumberMeaning.m can be used to display the meaning of an
% event code you encounter.  When you update this function, you should
% consider updating that one too.

% Created 6/10 by DJ
% Updated 7/29/10 by DJ (added Target/Distractor codes)
% Updated 8/19/10 by DJ (added threshold values)
% Updated 10/18/10 by DJ (added BLINK).
% Updated 2/24/11 by DJ (added SEES, SIM_BUTTON).
% Updated 4/18/11 by DJ (multiplied all anchoring constants by 10 to
% accommodate new levels with >50 objects).
% Updated 6/2/11 by DJ - added _START and _END codes for saccades,
%   fixations, and smooth pursuit
% Updated 8/4/11 by DJ - added optional input 'when' (for old files)
