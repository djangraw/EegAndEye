function Numbers = NEDE_GetNumbers

% Get the constants specific to the 3DSearch task.

% Numbers = NEDE_GetNumbers

%
% INPUTS:

% OUTPUTS:
% -Numbers is the struct of constants.
%
% Should be similar to the constants section of Numbers.js from the 
% current experiment (adjusting variable declarations for MATLAB).
%
% Function GetNumberMeaning.m can be used to display the meaning of an
% event code you encounter.  When you update this function, you should
% consider updating that one too.
