%
% - This function takes an eyelink text file and extracts the times when
% events were sent via parallel port to the EEG.  This can be compared
% against the times when the EEG received these events.
% - The input should be the file
% - To create the eyelink text file, we must open the .edf file created
% during a 3D Search (3DS) experiment and select "Generate Report -->
% recording event sequence data" from the menu.  
% - The first line must read
% START 1234567 (where 1234567 is the Eyelink timestamp for the start of
% recording).


% Setup
fid = fopen(text_file);
fseek(fid,0,'eof'); % find end of file
eof = ftell(fid);
fseek(fid,0,'bof'); % rewind to beginning

word = 'write_ioport';
ts_event = []; %each row is timestamp, event
i = 0;          % number of elements currently in word_vec

% First row should have start timestamp
str = fgetl(fid);
starttime = sscanf(str,'START %d');
if isempty(starttime)
    error('START timestamp is not the first line in the data file!');

% Main Loop
while ftell(fid) < eof % if we haven't found it
    str = fgetl(fid);
    if findstr(str,word);
        i = i+1;
        ts_event(i,:) = sscanf(str,'MSG %d !CMD 0 write_ioport 0x378 %d');
    end
end

% Did we find the word anywhere?
