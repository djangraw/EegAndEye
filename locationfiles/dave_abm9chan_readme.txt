dave_abm9chan.loc is my best guess for the ABM_9ch electrode locations.
Here's my reasoning:
- I got the channel names from an email from Matthew Jaswa (12/3/12),
where he says the SDK documentation says the order of channels is:
EKG[1], POz[2], Fz[3], Cz[4], C3[5], C4[6], F3[7], F4[8], P3[9], P4[10].
- I copied lines from the dave_sensorium90_84chan.loc file that match
the names of the channels (this should roughly correspond to their 10-10
locations).
